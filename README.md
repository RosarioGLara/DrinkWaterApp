# 🥤 Hydration Tracker — My First Python App!

Hi, I’m **Rosario**, and I’m super excited to share my **first completed desktop app** built with **Python** and the **Tkinter library**. This project kicks off my journey into building wellness-focused mini apps with joy and purpose!

## 💡 What It Does

- 💧 **Tracks daily water intake** by logging each glass  
- 🎯 **Set personal hydration goals** (e.g., 8 glasses/day)  
- ⏰ **Hourly reminders** to keep you on track throughout the day  

This app encourages small, healthy habits with gentle nudges and satisfying progress feedback.
